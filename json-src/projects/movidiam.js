It features social network profiling for freelancers to display their work, write blogs, post status updates as well as feature contact information for potential clients. This profiling also links into a map-based search system, allowing users to enter a search term such as "Camera operator in New York" which will then supply a list of results matching that criteria, in a similar manner to Airbnb’s search page. Movidiam also offer a briefing system where users can contact Movidiam to request a specific type or multiple types of users to help them creating a production - the chosen responses coming from the 20K+ freelancers registered to the service.`,

I helped shape the UI and UX of the platform through my experience and understanding of good user experience principals and worked with Sketch and Photoshop to convey these processes. I championed new technologies and methodologies to follow while keeping the codebase reusable and concise. I worked on areas from email templates, Salesforce pages and the product itself, as well as an internal admin dashboard, all of which were accomplished with technologies such as Ember.js, Ember Data, Docker and other core web-dev technologies. I worked with the backend developers on a daily basis with REST API's and had some hand in server management with AWS S3 and EC2 instances. Other duties included:`,
