The hit-box for each enemy is a transformed element that corresponds to the position and shape of the relevant appendage; arm, leg, head, etc. each of which, when clicked effect the damage applied to an enemy, as well as flagging the area hit for the score board at the end of the game.`,

Their health was also randomised within a specific range based on the enemy type, to give a further challenge to players. I added the ability to replenish the players health via a collectable that appears on the table as a random chance drop by every defeated enemy - they will sit there indefinitely until a player clicks on them - again, spawning within a set area at random positions and scaling appropriately.`,

        content: `As well as the base game itself, I created a few reusable "components" such as an infinite, scalable carousel for the games opening instructions as well as experimentiht with spritesheets to save on requests when loading the games graphics. I also, at least for the desktop version of the game, included an audio engine that played music as well as sound effects reflecting the action happening on screen such as the firearm sound effects, enemy attacks, etc. While the code within this project is, even by standards of the time very messy, it was my first project working heavily with JavaScript and is something I am still proud of, despite its flaws.`,
