I have worked extensively on building single page applications with React as well as Ember and Angular frameworks over the last few years, working on ecommerce and social media platforms to project management suites.","I have a solid background in modern frontend technologies such as ES2019 features in JavaScript as well as working with Sass, utilising the BEM methodology  and working with Webpack in my work-flow to accelerate development. I have a proficient understanding of and experience with building cross-browser and cross-platform compatible solutions with meticulous attention to detail and the desire to get the little things just right.","I am experienced in working with, as well as leading, teams and have excellent communication skills for technical and non-technical audience. I have worked with REST API's and have a good understanding / familiarity with the command line, NPM and Yarn package management, source control via Git.","I work with a mobile first, responsive approach and have a passion for building beautiful, simple experiences that are functional first and foremost. While I am a perfectionist at heart when it comes to creating designs or merely converting them to working code, I know when to draw the line between pursuing perfection and delivering a feature in a timely fashion."],"contactDescription":["Whoa, kudos for making it this far!
