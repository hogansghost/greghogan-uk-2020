It features social network profiling for freelancers to display their work, write blogs, post status updates as well as feature contact information for potential clients. This profiling also links in to a map based search system, allowing users to enter a search term such as \"Camera operator in New York\" which will then supply a list of results matching that criteria, in a similar manner and presentation to Air B&B's search page. Movidiam also offer a briefing system where users can contact Movidiam to request a specific type or multiple types of users to help them creating a production - the chosen responses coming from the 17K+ members of Movidiam."

I helped shape the UI and UX of the platform through my experience and understanding of good user experience principals and worked with Sketch and Photoshop to convey these processes. I championed new technologies and methodologies to follow to enable a beautiful and functional interface while keeping the codebase reusable and concise. I worked on areas from email templates, Salesforce pages and the product itself, as well as an internal admin dashboard, all of which were accomplished with technologies such as Ember.js, Ember Data, Ember Animation/Liquid Fire, Docker and other core web-dev technologies. I worked with the back-end developers on a daily basis with REST API's and had some hand in server management with AWS S3 and EC2 instances."
