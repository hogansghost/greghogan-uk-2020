The hit-box for each enemy is a transformed element that corresponds to the position and shape of the relevant appendage; arm, leg, head, etc. each of which, when clicked effect the damage applied to an enemy, as well as flagging the area hit for the score board at the end of the game."

Their health was also randomised within a specific range based on the enemy type, to give a further challenge to players. I added the ability to replenish the players health via a collectable that appears on the table as a random chance drop by every defeated enemy - they will sit there indefinitely until a player clicks on them - again, spawning within a set area at random positions and scaling appropriately."

This profiling also links into a map-based search system, allowing users to enter a search term such as \"Camera operator in New York\" which will then supply a list of results matching that criteria, in a similar manner to Airbnb’s search page. Movidiam also offer a briefing system where users can contact Movidiam to request a specific type or multiple types of users to help them creating a production - the chosen responses coming from the 20K+ freelancers registered to the service."
